          <p>The slightest mention of AI and machine learning (ML) was enough to strike fear into the hearts of many not so long ago.<br><br><br><br><br>
            To be fair it’s not surprising, particularly given the cultural references we’ve been fed over the years – see Skynet (Terminator), Hal (2001: A Space Odyssey), and Ava (Ex-Machina) – it’s little wonder there’s been a smidgen of anxiety.



            The question still remains though, do we really have anything to worry about when it comes to automating our working lives via ML and AI?<br><br><br><br><br>

            The question still remains though, do we really have anything to worry about when it comes to automating our working lives via ML and AI?<br><br><br><br><br>



            Well, we automate for multiple reasons: repeatability, speed, parallelism and removal of operator error. All of these are great reasons; cloud computing followed that evolution only recently and now we have the ability to commission, configure, deploy and make available entire estates in minutes.<br><br><br><br><br>






            After all, whenever we see a branch of computing become popular, we seem to go through a similar curve of manual implementation; then often into a UI to make things easier; then into scripts that get things running manually (but repeatably); then into fully automated processes, and finally the automation of the quality gates around it.<br><br><br><br><br>
